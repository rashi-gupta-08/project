            <p>
                "MUTUAL AID REFERS TO A COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH WHERE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS COME TOGETHER TO <br>HELP EACH OTHER MEET THEIR NEEDS, USUALLY OUTSIDE OF FORMAL, GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEMS. ITâ€™S ROOTED <br>IN SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATION RATHER THAN CHARITY, FOCUSING <br> ON COLLECTIVE ACTION TO PROVIDE SUPPORT IN TIMES OF NEED."

            THIS CAN LOOK LIKE SHARING RESOURCES, SKILLS, OR TIME TO ASSIST THOSE WHO MIGHT BE FACING HARDSHIPS, 
            SUCH AS DISTRIBUTING FOOD,<br> OFFERING MEDICAL CARE, OR HELPING WITH CHILDCARE. 
            THE GOAL IS TO FOSTER SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND REDUCE RELIANCE ON SYSTEMS THAT MAY <br> NOT BE ACCESSIBLE OR EQUITABLE FOR EVERYONE. <br><br>
            
            MUTUAL AID INVOLVES NEIGHBORS COLLABORATING TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER, ESPECIALLY DURING CRISES.  
            THIS CAN INCLUDE SHARING RESOURCES, PROVIDING SERVICES LIKE CHILDCARE OR HOME REPAIRS, AND OFFERING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT.  
            SUCH GRASSROOTS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PIVOTAL IN ADDRESSING IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY BONDS.<br><br>
            
            DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF MUTUAL AID YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT OR WAYS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GETTING INVOLVED?<br>
            IF YES, THEN FILL THIS <a href="#">FORM</a>.<br><br>
            
            OR, IF YOU WANT ANY HELP FILL THIS <a href="#">FORM</a>.
